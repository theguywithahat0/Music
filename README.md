  <em>Normans in the South</em>
</p>


In the early 11th century, a band of restless warriors crossed the sea, lured by the clash of empires and the promise of land. These were the Normans — mercenaries, pilgrims, adventurers — and southern Italy would never be the same.

Normans in the South is the first chapter in a growing medieval rock/metal saga.
This debut EP follows the dramatic rise of the Normans in Italy through thunderous riffs and battle-scarred verses:

    Monte Gargano – The first encounter. A Lombard rebellion brews in Apulia, and Norman pilgrims are drawn into the fight.

    Cannae – The crushing defeat. Byzantines retaliate with fury, and the Norman dream falters in blood and dust.

    Aversa – The first foothold. Rainulf Drengot is made count, and a new Norman rise begins.

More EPs are coming, chronicling the age of the Hautevilles, the conquest of Sicily, and beyond.
Follow along as I turn one of history’s wildest tales into a metal saga.
