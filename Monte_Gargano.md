[Intro – Spoken, soft pads, ambient]  
[Melus approaches a band of Norman pilgrims outside the shrine of Saint Michael.]  
Hail good pilgrims, well met indeed,  
I seek your help, I am in need.  

[Verse 1 – Melus,, Slow, reverent build with strings]  
I am Melus, lord of Bari,  
The catapan took my city.  
To this mount I came to pray,  
Before the shrine at break of day.  
From foreign lands an emperor,  
Took my realm, but not my honor.


[Verse 2 – Low percussion enters, The Normans,  calm and firm]  
We came to pray, not to draw spears,  
As men of faith, as men of peace.  
We fly no flag, we serve no throne,  
We bend no knee, we stand alone.  
We’ve made no vow, come from afar—  
Why should we fight another’s war?

[Chorus 1 – Steady tempo, hopeful tone]  
Ride with me, and take your stand,  
With Saint Michael's good omen,  
Heed my call, ye Norman men,  
Bring forth a new age for my land.

[Verse 3 – Stronger rhythm, impassioned tone from Melus]  
The Emperor with iron rules,  
Takes from our fields into his hoard.  
These eastern men take us for fools,  
They preach of peace, yet wield the sword.  
We call for men who will not yield,  
To join us on the battlefield.

[Verse 4 – The Normans, cool and calculating]  
We bow to no lord, we are free,  
We owe no oath, no fe-al-ty.  
And like our steeds we won't be tamed,  
Why should we wage war in your name?  
We may return, if terms ring true,  
And honor awaits  those who do.

[Bridge – Low strings, organ tones, Melus praying]  
Saint Michael, knight of heaven’s host,  
Without these men my cause is lost.  
Guide them home across the land,  
Then lead them back with sword in hand.

[Chorus 2 – Full instrumentation, triumphant feel]  
Ride with me, let swords be drawn,
In the name of Saint Michael,
Raise your banners, heed my call
To this land bring a new dawn!

[Outro – Soft, slow strings and voice]  
They rode away, to home and kin,  
Their souls washed clean from all their sin.  
But then returned, their banners raised,  
They would come to the Lombard's aid.

[Finale – Rising orchestration, layered vocals]  
Brave knights, cadets from Normandy,  
Will make their mark in history!
